In this blog post we will learn how to make a Toolbar and a Bottom Navigation Bar in Jetpack Compose.

There are two types of AppBars in Jetpack Compose: `TopAppBar `and `BottomAppBar.` Let‚Äôs explore `TopAppBar `first.

`TopAppBar `in Jetpack Compose is basically the toolbar in Android. There are two implementations of `TopAppBar `in Jetpack Compose, let‚Äôs explore their method signatures one by one.

```kt
@Composable
fun TopAppBar(
    title: @Composable() () -> Unit,
    color: Color = (+MaterialTheme.colors()).primary,
    navigationIcon: @Composable() (() -> Unit)? = null
)
```

This is pretty straight forward. In the `title,` you can specify the text that appears on the toolbar. You can use `color `to specify the color of the toolbar by default it uses the primary color of the theme that you are using. `navigationIcon `is an icon that appears on the left side of the title, typically used to open the navigation drawer, although you can customise what happens on clicking on the `navigationIcon `in your implementation.

Let‚Äôs have a look at the second implementation of `TopAppBar.`

```kt
@Composable
fun <T> TopAppBar(
    title: @Composable() () -> Unit,
    actionData: List<T>,
    color: Color = (+MaterialTheme.colors()).primary,
    navigationIcon: @Composable() (() -> Unit)? = null,
    action: @Composable() (T) -> Unit
    // TODO: support overflow menu here with the remainder of the list
)
```

Two additional fields that we see here are `actionData `and `action.` Although the naming is a bit weird but all they do is tell you what `actionData `should be shown at the end of the toolbar. You can have at max 2 icons in the toolbar other than the `navigationIcon,` if you use more than 2 icons then the extra icons should appear in an overflow menu but as you can see in the comment above, this functionality is still not there. `action `defines what should be done when the user clicks on your `actionData `in the toolbar. For instance if your `actionData `is a search icon, the `action `would be to allow you to search for something. The following example will make things more clear.

```kt
TopAppBar(
          navigationIcon = {
                AppBarIcon(
                            +imageResource(R.drawable.baseline_menu_white_18dp)
                    ) { /* do something here */ }
                },
                title = { Text(text = "Jetpack Compose") },
                actionData = listOf(
                +imageResource(R.drawable.baseline_search_white_18dp)
        )
        )
        { actionImage ->
            AppBarIcon(actionImage) { /* do something here */ }
        }
```

Here we have set the title of the toolbar using a `Text `component. We are providing an image of the search icon in the `actionData.` `AppBarIcon `is used to make an icon in the toolbar using the image which we provide in the `actionData.` `AppBarIcon `is also used to make the `navigationIcon.` The screenshot below shows the result of the above code.

Let‚Äôs explore the other `AppBar `which is `BottomAppBar.` `BottomAppBar `is basically the Bottom Navigation bar in Android. Let‚Äôs have a look at its method signature.

```kt
@Composable
fun <T> BottomAppBar(
    color: Color = (+MaterialTheme.colors()).primary,
    navigationIcon: @Composable() (() -> Unit)? = null,
    fabConfiguration: FabConfiguration? = null,
    actionData: List<T> = emptyList(),
    action: @Composable() (T) -> Unit = {}
    // TODO: support overflow menu here with the remainder of the list
)
```

You might notice that `BottomAppBar `has a similar method signature as `TopAppBar,` `fabConfiguration `is the only field that is different. If you don‚Äôt need a fab just let the field be null otherwise you can configure the fab according to your needs. `FabConfiguration `is a data class which looks like this

```kt
 data class FabConfiguration(
        internal val fabPosition: FabPosition = FabPosition.Center,
        internal val cutoutShape: Shape? = null,
        internal val fab: @Composable() () -> Unit
    )
```

Basically here you can specify the position of the `fab `which takes a default value of centre, other than that you can place it at the right side. `cutoutShape `is the shape that will be cut off from the `BottomAppBar `to fit the fab. The following example will make things more clear.

```kt
            BottomAppBar(
                    navigationIcon = {
                        AppBarIcon(
                                +imageResource(R.drawable.baseline_home_white_18dp)
                        ) { /* do something here */ }
                    }
                    ,
                    fabConfiguration = BottomAppBar.FabConfiguration(cutoutShape = CircleShape) {
                        FloatingActionButton(
                                color = (+MaterialTheme.colors()).secondary,
                                icon = +imageResource(R.drawable.baseline_check_white_18dp),
                                onClick = { /* do something here */ })
                    },
                    actionData = listOf(
                            +imageResource(R.drawable.baseline_person_white_18dp)
                    )
            ) { actionImage ->
                AppBarIcon(actionImage) {
                    /* do something here */
                }
            }
```

The code snippet above is similar to how we setup the `TopAppBar.` Only difference is here we have to define the `fabConfiguration `as well. We are using `circleShape `in `cutOutShape,` the gap between the `BottomAppBar `and `fab `that you see in the screenshot below is because of this parameter, you can pass a null value if you don‚Äôt want it. `navigationIcon `is the left most icon in the `BottomAppBar `just like it was in `TopAppBar.`

![ INSET_CENTER](https://miro.medium.com/1*HaU3aYcWr0FlYF1aXnP7Nw.png)

When you have a fab which is centred then you can have at max 2 icons in the `BottomAppBar `in addition to the `navigationIcon `otherwise if there is no fab or the fab is positioned in the end you can have at max 4 icons in the `BottomAppBar.`

This is how you can use `AppBars `in Jetpack Compose to create `TopAppBar `and `BottomAppBar.`

One thing that I realised after exploring AppBars is that I never thought Bottom Navigation Bar and Toolbar worked in a similar manner and lot of code can be reused like it has been done in Jetpack Compose. Jetpack Compose is really promising and I can‚Äôt wait to see its stable version!

The code snippets used in this blog post are from this repository, feel free to check it out.



Jetpack Compose is still in developer preview, there will be breaking changes in the future so some of the things that I mentioned might change over time.
